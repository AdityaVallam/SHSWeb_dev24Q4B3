                <img/>
                <p>As the NFL draft started, Jefferson expected to be taken in the first round.</p>
                <p>Much to his delight, the Minnesota Vikings took him 22nd overall.</p>
                <p>His career immeadiately got off to a hot start.</p>
                <p>In his first ever start, JJ finished with 175 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
                <p>He would end up breaking the rookie receiving yards record, finishing the season with 1400 yards. He would become one of the only rookies to be named to the Pro Bowl.</p>
                <p>He would only become better and better. In 2021, he finished with 10 tds and 1600 yards. After earning his second Pro Bowl selection, it was clear that JJ was the next Randy Moss for Minnesota. Fans loved him and he quickly became a household name with his signature dance, the griddy.</p>
                <p>2023 had many more things in store for JJ. He had one of the best seasons for a Wide Reciever in the NFL ever. At the end of the regular season, he finished with 128 receptions, 1809 yards and 8 touchdowns.</p>
